The source code for the Azure Mobile Apps Cordova plugin is available at https://github.com/Azure/azure-mobile-apps-js-client. The code is packed in a standalone Javascript bundle and is added to this repository for packaging as a Cordova plugin.

## Getting Started

If you are new to Mobile Apps, you can get started by following [Mobile Apps documentation](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-value-prop/).

### Offline data sync

Offline data sync is a feature of Azure Mobile Apps that makes it easy for developers to create apps that are functional without a network connection. Offline data sync is now available in the Cordova SDK. For detailed documentation, known issues and future work refer this [README](https://github.com/azure/azure-mobile-apps-js-client/tree/cordova-2.0.0).

### Sample usage ###
The following code creates a new client object to access the *todolist* mobile apps backend and create a new proxy object for the *TodoItem* table.

    var mobileAppsClient = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient(
            "https://todolist.azurewebsites.net"
        );

    var todoTable = mobileAppsClient.getTable('TodoItem');
    
### Quickstart ###
