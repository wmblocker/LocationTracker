                Privacy Policy
                This Privacy Policy was last modified on June 27, 2017.
                Blocker Technologies (“BlockerTech,” “we,” or “us”) are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of information that is collected through our mobile app and our website (collectively, our “Service”), as well as your choices regarding the collection and use of information. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our Terms of Use.
                1. How We Collect and Use Information
                We collect the following types of information about you:
                Registration and Profile Information. When you create an account, we may collect your personal information such as your username, first and last name, email address, mobile phone number and a photo, if you chose to have a photo associated with your account. If you want to add a family member’s name to your account, we collect the family member’s name, email address, and mobile phone number. We may also collect billing information when you sign up for Premium service.
                Data collected through use of the Service. After you set up your account, we may ask for other profile and demographic information, such as personal emergency instructions and information, and nickname.
                Geolocation. We collect your unique user identifier and your location through GPS, WiFi, or wireless network triangulation in order to obtain your location for the purposes of providing our Service. We collect the location of your designated “Places” to provide alerts when family members arrive and leave. If you turn off location sharing in one or more of your circles, we will not share your location with such circles; however, we will continue to collect your location information in order to provide the Service (for example, to provide our emergency services or to share your location with the other circles you continue to allow to see your location, or to provide advertising). We maintain location information only so long as is reasonable to provide the Service and then delete location data tied to your personal information. We may maintain de-identified location data for a longer period of time in order to analyze aggregate trends and metrics. We may also share location information with third parties for advertising, research, and analytic purposes. If you want to opt-out of the collection of your location data, please adjust your settings in your mobile device to limit the app’s access to your location data. Please see “Your Choices About Your Information” below to learn more.
                Messages and User Content. We collect information when you message other members of your Family through use of the service. We may also retain any messages you send to us.
                We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service and to communicate directly with you, such as to send you alerts on the movements of your Family members, crime alerts in your neighborhood, etc. You can control your receipt of email and text alerts by visiting “Settings” and “Alert Options” within the mobile app. We may also send you Service-related emails (e.g., account verification, parental consent notification, order confirmations, change or updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices). You may not opt-out of Service-related e-mails.
