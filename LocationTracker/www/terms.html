                8. Features of the Service
                The Service includes a number of features which may or may not be available to you depending on which features you elect and, where required, pay or subscribe to use.  Some of the Service features require Mobile Software to be installed on the devices that the features apply to.  This section identifies some of the types of features that are part of the Service, and that may be available for you to use or pay or subscribe to use, along with important information about those features.
                A. Location Information Features.
                There are features that are designed to collect and share location information, about you and other individuals who use the Service.  These features require the corresponding Mobile Software to be installed on the device for which location data will be provided, and the features may not work if the corresponding settings to allow the collection and sharing of information and location information are not enabled.  In addition, the features may not work for a variety of reasons, such as if the device that the Mobile Software is installed on is not powered on and connected to the wireless service provider’s network (e.g., it will not work if the phone is connected to a wi-fi network), if location services are turned off, if the Service is not being used or is blocked on the device, etc.
                If you use features designed to collect and share location information, the Service will periodically access and collect information about your device and location (such information will be Company Content under this Agreement).  By using the features designed to collect and share information, you represent and warrant that you have consented, to use the service and to allow it to access and collect such information.

                7.         Additional Policies and Information About the Service and Service Features
                This section contains additional policies and information about the Service and Service features including geographic coverage information, billing policies, and pricing and payment terms.
                A. Geographic Coverage.
                The Service is designed for residents of the contiguous U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii, though some features of the Service may not work in areas outside the wireless service coverage area for the phone that the Mobile Software is installed on.
                B. Billing Policies.
                If you elect to use features of the Service that have charges or subscriptions (“Subscription Features”) you agree to the pricing and payment terms and that we may update them from time to time. Company may add new features for additional fees and charges, or amend fees and charges for existing services, at any time in its sole discretion.  Any change to our pricing or payment terms shall become effective in the billing cycle following notice of such change to you as provided in this Agreement.
                C. Pricing and Payment Terms
                i. Subscription/access fees are payable in advance.
                All subscription and access charges for the Subscription Features are payable in advance. Company is not responsible for any charges or expenses you incur resulting from charges billed by Company in accordance with this Agreement (e.g. overdrawn accounts, exceeding credit card limit, etc.). By providing a credit card number or other payment method with advance authorization features (e.g. some PayPal accounts, or in-app payments such as from third parties like Apple or Google), you authorize Company to continue charging the payment method for all charges due Company until your account is settled and your subscription is terminated by either you or Company. Company reserves the right to limit the number of accounts that may be charged to a credit card or other payment or identification method per unique user.
                ii. Subscription accounts may have a trial period.
                After initial registration of certain Subscription Features, you may be given an initial trial period beginning with your first login to your account. You may cancel your account at any time during the trial. If you want to change your account type, you may do so at any time (either before or after the trial period). You are limited to one trial per person (credit card or other unique payment or identification method) for any 12-month period. If you do not cancel your account during the trial, you will be charged based on the account type you selected during registration. To cancel a subscription to a Subscription Feature at any time, send an email to support@blockertech.com.
                iii. Payment methods.
                Company accepts credit and debit cards issued through VISA, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover.   Company also accepts in-app payments such as from third parties like Apple or Google.   Company requires that you provide the security code for your debit or credit card to help protect against the unauthorized use of your card by other persons. The security code is an individual three- or four-digit number specific to your card that may be printed on the face of your card above the embossed account number (if American Express), or on the back of your card, on the signature panel (if Visa, or MasterCard). In the event that Company is unable to charge the card you have provided (e.g., expired credit card), Company will send you a notice to update your card information. You will have a 14-day grace period to update your billing information. If the account is not updated within the 14-day grace period, Company will terminate your subscription.
                iv. Pricing Changes
                Prices for Subscription Features may change from time to time, in Company’s sole discretion.  If they do, and you currently have Subscription Features, Company will provide you with notice of the change through the Service or in email to you, at Company’s option, at least 30 days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Subscription Features after price changes become effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount.  If you do not agree to the new prices, please follow the instructions in the “Closing Your Account” section below.  You (and not Company) are responsible for any charges or fees payable to third parties in connection with the Service, such as ambulances and other emergency responders.
                D. No Refunds.
                You may cancel your account at any time; however, there are no refunds for any unused time on a subscription, any license or subscription fees for any portion of the Service, any content or data associated with your account, or for anything else. Upon cancelling any Subscription Features, your subscription will be valid until your paid period is completed.
                E. Payment Information; Taxes.
                All information that you provide in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service must be accurate, complete, and current. You agree to pay all charges incurred by users of your credit card, debit card, or other payment method used in connection with a purchase or transaction or other monetary transaction interaction with the Service at the prices in effect when such charges are incurred. You will pay any applicable taxes, if any, relating to any such purchases, transactions or other monetary transaction interactions.
                F.  Battery Usage
                Use of the Service or Service features that require the use of Mobile Software may use a significant amount of power from the battery of any device that the Mobile Software is installed on.  You may wish to limit your use of these or other services on your device to the times when they are necessary (e.g., you may want to turn off certain Service features when you are not driving, or you may want to turn off other applications and services when you are driving), or where possible, you might wish to keep your phone plugged into a power source.

                15. Governing Law and Arbitration
                A. Governing Law.
                You agree that: (i) the Service shall be deemed solely based in California; and (ii) the Service shall be deemed a passive one that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Company, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than California. This Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of California, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences with respect to the substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16). The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located in Santa Clara County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, as set forth in the Arbitration provision below.
                B. Arbitration.
                READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES THE PARTIES TO ARBITRATE THEIR DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM COMPANY. In the unlikely event that Company has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after 60 days, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding any Company claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms of Use, or the breach or alleged breach thereof (collectively, “Claims”), by binding arbitration by the Judicial Mediation and Arbitration Services (“JAMS”) under the Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures then in effect for JAMS, except as provided herein. The arbitration will be conducted in Santa Clara County, California, unless you and Company agree otherwise. Each party will be responsible for paying any JAMS filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with JAMS rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys’ fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed as preventing Company from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to protect any of Company’s proprietary interests. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES’ INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THIS WAIVER APPLIES TO CLASS ARBITRATION, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND COMPANY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, COLLECTIVE ACTION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING OF ANY KIND.
                16. General
                A. Assignment.
                This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Company without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.
                B. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement.
                Company may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via email notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website or mobile application, as determined by Company in our sole discretion. Company reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Company is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Company may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.
                C. Entire Agreement/Severability.
                This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Company in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Company concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
                D. No Waiver.
                No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Company’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
